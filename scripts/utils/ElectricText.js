    <ul>
        <li><p>Electric energy transfer can be categorized as kinetic and potential energy depending on the context.</p></li>
        <li><p>One electron carries exactly 1.602176634&#xd7;10<sup>-19</sup> Coulombs</p></li>
        <li><p>One Ampere is equivalent to 1 Coulomb flowing per second, which also means it's representing 6.241509074&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup> electrons flowing every second</p></li>
        <li><p>The units Ampere, Ohm, Volt, and Joule are all named after real scientist who were alive around 200-300 years ago</p></li>
        <li><p>Electricity travels at the speed of light, around 299792458 m/s (without decimals surprisingly!) </p></li>

    <h1>Electrostatic Energy Facts</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Electrostatic Energy, surprisingly, does not calculate the amount of energy in static electricity discharge.</p></li>
        <li><p>"The term 'electric potential energy' is used to describe the potential energy in systems with time-variant electric fields, while the term 'electrostatic potential energy' is used to describe the potential energy in systems with time-invariant electric fields." - Wikipedia</p></li>
        <li><p>Electrostatic Electricity is just one branch of many in the field of Electromagnetism<p></li>
        <li><p>The only difference between electrostatic energy and electrostatic force in a system of charges is one factor of r in the formua</p></li>
        <li><p>The 4&#960;r<sup>2</sup> in the electrostatic force formula comes from the area of the shape of influence of an electric charge, which is a sphere</p></li>
